# Operators mixin

Note that you cannot combine razor extended expression (+, -,  /, *, etc.) with go template expression such as in:

## Razor syntax

```go
# In this statement, | is interpreted as bitwise or between 2 and 4
8

# While in this statement (no binary operator), | is interpreted as go template piping operator
10
```

## gotemplate syntax

```go
8
10
```

### Result

```go
8
10
```
