### Looping (Maps)

#### Razor (Maps)

```go
    test, 1, 1
    test2, 3, 3
    test3, 4, 4
    test5, 5, 5
```

#### Gotemplate (Maps)

```go
    test, 1, 1
    test2, 3, 3
    test3, 4, 4
    test5, 5, 5
```

#### Result (Maps)

```go
    test, 1, 1
    test2, 3, 3
    test3, 4, 4
    test5, 5, 5
```

## Slices

| ``      | ``      | Prepend
| `["test0","test1","test2","test3","test4"]`                                    | `["test0","test1","test2","test3","test4"]`                                       | Should be `["test0","test1","test2","test3","test4"]`
| `true`        | `true`              | Check if element is in list
| `true`                      | `true`                           | has is an alias to contains
| `true`                      | `true`                           | has Support inversion of argument if the first one is not a list
| `true`             | `true`                   | has can also test for many elements
| `true`         | `true`               | List also support using methods
| `["test4","test3","test2","test1","test0"]`                          | `["test4","test3","test2","test1","test0"]`                                | Should be `["test4","test3","test2","test1","test0"]`

### Looping (Slice)

#### Razor (Slice)

```go
    0, test0, test0
    1, test1, test1
    2, test2, test2
    3, test3, test3
    4, test4, test4
```

#### Gotemplate (Slice)

```go
    0, test0, test0
    1, test1, test1
    2, test2, test2
    3, test3, test3
    4, test4, test4
```

#### Result (Slice)

```go
    0, test0, test0
    1, test1, test1
    2, test2, test2
    3, test3, test3
    4, test4, test4
```
